# ConPar
Configure and initialize Python Classes using JSON and other files.

The latin word `conpar` means "equal to" or "resembling" if used as an 
adjective 
while the noun `conpar` can be interpreted as "fellow" or "partner". In that
sense, this package is intended to load and initialize Python packages from 
configuration files (such as JSON or YAML files) equal to code written in a 
`.py` file.
